	- When you create a load a buffer in directx, it takes up memory. we can't
	  do this every frame unless we free every frame. that is not very
	  efficent, so we need to create a system that will keep track of the
  	assets and only loads the ones that has not been loaded yet. We also
	  need a system that will free assets that we are not using anymore
